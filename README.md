# <The Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for this webpage is to have a place to keep notes taken during the prework phase of the coding bootcamp
-I built this project to get an initial peek into the world of coding in a project format.
- This webpage resolved the issue of not having a universally accessable location to store my coding bootcamp prework notes.
- I learned version control, Github, Javascript, CSS, and HTML as outlined below:
    •	HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the most basic building block of websites. It handles the content of a website, as well as its structure and the meaning of each element on the page. Along with CSS and JavaScript, HTML is one of the three core languages of the web.
    •	Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language used to describe the presentation of a website that’s created with HTML and how each element on a webpage is rendered.
    •	JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that is used to provide logic and interactivity for websites.
    •	The command line, also known as the terminal, is a text interface for running computer programs, navigating the files and folders on your computer, and working with web development tools.
    •	Markdown is a simple markup language used to create formatted text using a plain-text editor. You will use Markdown to quickly and easily create documentation about the websites you work on.
    •	Git is a free, open source version control system that allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work. It also allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a problem is discovered.
    •	GitHub is the largest provider of internet hosting for software and web development code, and provides the version control functionality of Git in a central repository.
    •	Deployment is the process that makes a website or an update to a website available to users.

The notes have been segmented into four different sections; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. There is the option to open the devTools Console and see the JavaScipt in action, which randomly selects a topic to study everytime you visit the webpage.
