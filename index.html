        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash. </li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together using a comma.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>To code/modification to working branch run: git add -A. This stages the modifications for committ</li>
          <li>To Commit changes with a commit message run: git commit -m “message”</li>
          <li>Git is a tool that allows developers and others to use version control.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— () —it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job.</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It essentially "locks down" what that variable will be, and once we declare it, we can never reassign it.</li>
